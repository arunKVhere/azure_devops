# Kubernetes Services  
In this section we will take a look at **`services`** in kubernetes

## Services
- Kubernetes Services enables communication between various components within and outside of the application.
  
#### Let's look at some other aspects of networking
   
    
 ## Service Types
 
 #### There are 3 types of service types in kubernetes
 
 1. NodePort
    - Where the service makes an internal port accessible on a port on the NODE.
      ```
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Service
      metadata:
       name: myapp-service
      spec:
       types: NodePort
       ports:
       - targetPort: 80
         port: 80
         nodePort: 30008
      ```

      #### To connect the service to the pod
      ```
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Service
      metadata:
       name: myapp-service
      spec:
       type: NodePort
       ports:
       - targetPort: 80
         port: 80
         nodePort: 30008
       selector:
         app: myapp
         type: front-end
       ```
      
      #### To create the service
      ```
      $ kubectl create -f service-definition.yaml
      ```
      
      #### To list the services
      ```
      $ kubectl get services
      ```
     
            
 1. ClusterIP
    - In this case the service creates a **`Virtual IP`** inside the cluster to enable communication between different services such as a set of frontend servers to a set of backend servers.
    
 1. LoadBalancer
    - Where the service provisions a **`loadbalancer`** for our application in supported cloud providers.
